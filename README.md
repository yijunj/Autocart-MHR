# Autocart-MHR
Automatic and repeated carting machine for Monster Hunter Rise talisman farming

## Background
Talisman is a key equipment in Monster Hunter Rise, with the capability of providing highly rated skills and slots. However, obtaining good (or even god) talismans requires effort and in-game resources, as they are generated from a random melding pot known as the Wisp of Mystery. A good description of the talisman mechanism can be found [here](https://game8.co/games/Monster-Hunter-Rise/archives/327175).

The problem is, melding pot takes a huge amount of materials, and each melding requires finishing a (non-expedition) quest to complete. It has been long discovered that the most efficient quest to take is the arena Rajang, and keep carting 10 times will complete 10 meldings in a "short" amount of time (about 15 minutes manually).
