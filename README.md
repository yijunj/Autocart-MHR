# Autocart-MHR
Automatic and repeated carting machine for Monster Hunter Rise talisman farming

## Background
Talisman is a key equipment in Monster Hunter Rise, with the capability of providing highly rated skills and slots. However, obtaining good (or even god) talismans requires effort and in-game resources, as they are generated from a random melding pot known as the Wisp of Mystery. A good description of the talisman mechanism can be found [here] (https://game8.co/games/Monster-Hunter-Rise/archives/327175)
